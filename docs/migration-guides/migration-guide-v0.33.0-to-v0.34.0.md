# [v0.34.0]

## BREAKING CHANGE

Following changes in AccelByte Cloud OpenAPI specification:
- Model `ApiMatchRuleSet` is replaced with `ApiRuleSetPayload`

The new model(s) above are compatible with the models it is replacing. If you are affected, a simple rename should be sufficient; i.e. rename `ApiMatchRuleSet` with `ApiRuleSetPayload`.
